## React Calculator Challenge

A calculator built with React. Made with functional components and hooks. Display screen is responsive and will scale down to fit required amount of characters. It features exponential notation when the value reaches 15 characters in length.

I've spent a lot of time working on this the past two days. I'm very interested in working with you guys. I encourage you to look at the code. All the heavy lifting (JavaScript/React stuff) is done. More features such as navigation, light/dark mode, styling, and refactoring coming before sunday.

I felt really good about the company culture after speaking with you two. I hope after looking through the code you'll get a good feeling about my technical ability. I'm very confident I can perform the job. I look forward to hearing from you.
