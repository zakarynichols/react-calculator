## React Calculator Challenge

A calculator built with React. Made with functional components and hooks. Display screen is responsive and will scale down to fit required amount of characters. It features exponential notation when the value reaches 15 characters in length.

I've spent a lot of time working on this the past two days. I encourage you to look at the code. All the heavy lifting writing the logic with React is done. More features such as navigation, light/dark mode, styling, and refactoring coming before sunday.
